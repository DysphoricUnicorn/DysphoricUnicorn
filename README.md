# Hello and welcome to my github profile

## About me
I'm a 20-something full stack engineer who does their best to build accessible websites (and make their peers do the same.)

When talking about me please use either _they/them_, _nin/nins_ or _she/her_ pronouns.
__There are so many to chose from!__ Just do not use _"he/him"_.

At my dayjob I mostly work on frontends with React and Material-ui.  
My side projects are a mix of PHP, Python and JS. Most of that sadly isn't open sourced yet but I am planning on fixing that.
