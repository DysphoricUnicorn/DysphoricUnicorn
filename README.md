## About me
I'm a 20-something full stack engineer who does their best to build accessible websites (and make their peers do the same.)

When talking about me please use either _they/them_, _nin/nins_ or _she/her_ pronouns.
__There are so many to chose from!__ Just do not use _"he/him"_.

At my last job I used to work with PHP and JS and that's what most of my side projects are built on as well. And while most of them aren't (yet) public, I do have many of those.

My current goal is to prepare as many side projects to be in a usable and maintainable state so I can finally open source them so stay tuned for that ^^
