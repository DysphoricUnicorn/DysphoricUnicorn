# Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile

## About me

I'm a DevOps engineer who does their best to build accessible websites and make their peers do the same :p

When talking about me please use either _they/them_, _nin/nins_ or _she/her_ pronouns.

At my dayjob I mostly work on frontends with React and Material-ui. I also build apps using React native.

My side projects are a mix of JS, (Î¼)Python and some older stuff in PHP.  
I also do some gamedev stuff using Godot when I find the time and motivation.

I'm currently getting started on working on some more hardware projects, maybe those will be interesting to someone.

In addition to all of that tech stuff, I also like to grow food, especially chilies.
